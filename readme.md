# Connect 4

#### By Mohamed Mohamed

## Overview

This is Project 1 of my GA software engineering immersive course. The goals are to create a fully functioning game with logic in order to output a winner. This ought to be illustrated with key skills from HTML, CSS and JS.

## The rules

Connect 4 is a game where players attempt to make a line of four pieces in a 7 x 6 grid. Players can drop their pieces into columns, so that their piece rests in the lowest available space in that column.

The winner is the first to create a line of four in any direction, including diagonally. If the board is filled before a line of 4 can be made, the game is declared a draw.

## HTML

I sculpted my whole project around my HTMl. After having planned what elements I'd need in my HTML file, I decided what skills I could use in the CSS and JS in order to have a fully rounded project. I kept my HTML document very simple in order that I showcase my ability to use JS along with CSS to manipulate a very simple HTML document.

## CSS

I used flexbox avidly in this project. Again my previous experience with the tutorials really came into fruition here. There were some challenges in order to have certain aspects the way I wanted but I'd say the learning curve though steep was very much appreciated. I feel my ability to use CSS to aesthetically manipulate any project from here on in will grow from strength to strength. I thoroughly enjoyed using resources like mdn and css tricks to diagnose and resolve problems.

## JS

Challenging is an understatement. The planning for this a part was an integral part of having a fully functioning game comissioned properly.
I broke this part into several different chunks in order to simplify - what I considered to be a huge task.
Firstly I developed a way to create a playing arena, in this instance a grid.

I had to think throughly about how dynamic attribution of class would be integral to the game logic.

I thereafter proceeded to creating a bomb proof logic which allow the counters of different colours to placed by the user.

After having done this I proceeded to initiate comprehensive logic in order for the game to dictate a winner.
On completion of those tasks I went on to you use query selectors to dynamically change the HTML. To match the logic in JS.

## What I learned.

Although this project was very challenging. I have consolidated knowledge of many aspects of HTML, CSS and JS including things like :

- For loops along with nested for loops
- understanding data types which is integral in order to manipulate code.
- use of the inspect tool including the console
- using querySelectors to target different parts of the program.
- use of flexbox
- use of wide range of element types in HTMl

Given the length of the project I also picked up key skills in time management along with the importance of using psedocode to code thoroughly.
